Taskify is a to-do application for organizing day-to-day tasks. It allows users to create new task with specific due dates, see what tasks they have scheduled for the day, check tasks off their to-do list, and track their task completion progress. The back-end is built with Node.js and Express, while the front-end uses React for a dynamic and responsive user experience. PostgreSQL is used as the database to store the to-do items.
